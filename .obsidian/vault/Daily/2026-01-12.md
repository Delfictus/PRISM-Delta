## Completed Today

### Implementation Work
- [x] **Unit 1.1**: `cryptic_features.rs` - 16-dim feature vector (commit: c4d88c2)
- [x] **Unit 1.2**: `gpu_zro_cryptic_scorer.rs` - 512-neuron reservoir + RLS (commit: 5e55a7a)

### Vault Maintenance
- [x] Created `Plans/Phase 6 Plan.md`
- [x] Created `Plans/Phase 7-8 Plan.md`
- [x] Created `Sessions/Session Log Template.md`

## Test Status

| Test Suite | Status |
|------------|--------|
| prism-validation lib | 114/114 pass |
| cryptic_features | 7/7 pass |
| Full compilation with `--features cryptic-gpu` | Pass |

## Code Changes

### cryptic_features.rs
- 16-dimensional feature vector
- Velocity encoding (40-dim buffer)
- Normalization methods
- Full test coverage

### gpu_zro_cryptic_scorer.rs
- 512-neuron DendriticSNNReservoir
- RLS online learning (lambda=0.99)
- Weight save/load
- Stability guards

---

## Next Actions

1. Create `tests/gpu_scorer_tests.rs`
   - Zero fallback test (CRITICAL)
   - RLS stability test
   - Weight persistence test

2. Download datasets
   - CryptoBench (1107 structures)
   - Apo-holo pairs (15 pairs)
